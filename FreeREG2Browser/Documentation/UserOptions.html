   <h1>User Options</h1>

   <p>This window shows those characteristics of the various displays that can be tailored to the user&#39;s requirements. At present, there are just two basic characteristics of the various lists that can be customised. These are, the method by which cells in the main data window can be edited, and whether or not a visible indicator is used whenever a data field is in the actual process of being edited.</p>

   <h3>Cell Edit Activation Mode</h3>
   
   <p>The lists displaying the various data records function as a spreadsheet and as in a spreadsheet, the initiation of of an edit operation can be customised to suit the user&#39;s preference.</p>

   <h3>Cell Edit Border</h3>
   
   <p>As a visual aid for the user, the program is capable of displaying a coloured border surrounding the field currently being edited. This may or may not be of some use some transcribers. The display of the border is controlled by the status of the checkbox: ticked means that the border will be shown, and unticked means that no border will be visible. The default is for the border to be displayed.</p>
