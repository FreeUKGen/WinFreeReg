   <h1>Burial Errors</h1>
   
   <p>This screen shows the contents of a Burial record by each field. The purpose of the display is to show which fields of the record are in error. Errors are indicated by way of a red-backed exclamation mark alongside a field. If you hover the mouse over the icon, an error message will be displayed.</p>

   <p>Correcting the error and pressing the OK button will eliminate that error and write the updated record back into the Workspace record list from whence the display originated. Upon return to the Workspace, the file can then be saved.</p>
