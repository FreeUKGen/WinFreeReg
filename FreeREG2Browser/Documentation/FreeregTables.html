   <h1>FreeREG Tables</h1>

   <p>One significant change between the old and the new programs is connected with the way in which uploaded files are now validated by the new FreeREG server. Previously, there existed a state of anarchy in the way that Place and Church names were spelled, leading to multiple interpretations of names and subsequent confusion for researchers. With the advent of FreeREG/2 and WinFreeREG, only Place and Church names already known to the server will be accepted in all transcription files.</p>

   <p>To aid the user in adhering to these constraints, WinFreeREG will only allow files to be created using names that it has previously obtained from the server. To facilitate this, under the Transcription Data drop-down menu, there is an option that you can use to obtain this so-called &#39;fixed&#39; data: <span class="boldword">FreeREG Tables.</span></p>

      <dd>FreeREG actually defines what 2-character codes are acceptable when starting a new file. Again, the reasoning is one of consistency. The user has no way of adding entries to the table or removing any entries. This can only be achieved by downloading the table again. </dd>
