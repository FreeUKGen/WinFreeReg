   <h1>FreeREG Tables</h1>

   <p>One significant change between the old and the new programs is connected with the way in which uploaded files are now validated by the new FreeREG server. Previously, there existed a state of anarchy in the way that Place and Church names were spelled, leading to multiple interpretations of names and subsequent confusion for researchers. With the advent of FreeREG/2 and WinFreeREG, only Place and Church names already known to the server will be accepted in all <span class="boldword"><strong>NEW</strong></span> transcription files.</p>

   <p>To aid the user in adhering to these constraints, WinFreeREG will only allow files to be created using names that it has previously obtained from the server. To facilitate this, under the Transcription Data drop-down menu, there is an option that you can use to obtain this so-called &#39;fixed&#39; data: <span class="boldword">FreeREG Tables.</span></p>

   <dl>
      <dt>Register Types</dt>
      <dd>FreeREG actually defines what 2-character codes are acceptable when starting a new file. Again, the reasoning is one of consistency. The user has no way of adding entries to the table or removing any entries. This can only be achieved by downloading the table again. </dd>
      <dt>Counties</dt>
      <dd>FreeREG now defines which Counties can be selected. This is slightly different to the case in WinREG, where the list of acceptable Counties was effectively hard-coded into the program. Transcribing can&#39;t really start until the list of counties has been downloaded from the FreeREG server.</dd>
      <dt>Place names</dt>
      <dd>As stated above, transcribers can now <span class="boldword">only</span> use those Placenames that have been defined by the FreeREG server. These have to be downloaded from the server before transcribing into new files can begin. Downloading is by County: so, select a county and click the <span class="boldword"><strong>Fetch</strong></span> button.</dd>
      <dt>Church names</dt>
      <dd>As with Placesnames, Church names are now defined on the FreeREG server, and need to be downloaded before transcribing begins. Churches are linked with Places: so, select the County and the Place name and click the <span class="boldword"><strong>Fetch</strong></span> button.</dd>
   </dl>
