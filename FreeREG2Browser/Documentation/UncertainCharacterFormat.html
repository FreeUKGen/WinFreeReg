   <h1>Uncertain Character Format</h1>

   <p>
   The Uncertain Character Format help dialog assists the user in entering various UCF elements into an individual data field. Upon entry, the Output field is filled with whatever was in the field being edited, and the cursor is placed accordingly. Now, simply move the cursor to where an insertion code should take place and click on one of the radio buttons to correspond with what you want to do, and follow the prompts.</p>
