   <h1>Data Errors</h1>

   <p>The Data Errors page is shown when the Workspace, where the user has been creating or editing a file, is closed and there are warnings and errors found in the file data. The inital window shows a list of all the errors remaining in the file. These can be either errors from editing the User Tables or from editing the three record types: Baptism, Burial and Marriage.</p>

   <p>The basic screen shows the type of record, the number of errors in that record and an error message. Multiple errors in a single record will be shown separately. Double-clicking on a line will then show the particular record that is in error along with some further indications of the error. The screen also shows where there is more than one error in the record.</p>
