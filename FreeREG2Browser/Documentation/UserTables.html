   <h1>User Tables</h1>

   <p>The data contained in these tables is used to control what the user can enter into certain specific fields of the transcription records. this data comprises 4 tables, viz.</p>

   <dl>
      <dt>Baptism Sex</dt>
      <dd>FreeREG actually limits the values that can be entered for the sex of a child being baptised. Consequently, there is a fixed set of values that can be selected: M or F or ? or blank</dd>

      <dt>Burial Relationships</dt>
      <dd>Burial records sometimes record the relationship of the deceased to one or more other people: child of, son of etc. It is not unknown for all types of unexpected relationships to have been recorded. As a result, whilst there are a set of standard entries in the table, it is possible for the user to add their own entries as and when they are encountered. FreeREG does not carry out any validation checks on the field in the transcription record.</dd>

      <dt>Groom Marriage Conditions</dt>
      <dd>In an effort to standardise certain transcribed elements, WinFreeREG defines a set of standard marriage conditions for grooms: bachelor, widower etc. These are kept in a table to which the user can add additional entries of their own as and when they coms across them. FreeREG does not validate these entries.</dd>

      <dt>Bride Marriage Conditions</dt>
      <dd>In an effort to standardise certain transcribed elements, WinFreeREG defines a set of standard marriage conditions for brides: spinster, widow etc. These are kept in a table to which the user can add additional entries of their own as and when they coms across them. FreeREG does not validate these entries.</dd>
   </dl>

   <p>All 4 tables function in exactly the same fashion when it comes to editing and maintenance. Entries in <span class="newStyle1">red</span> are the standard entries and can not be changed or deleted by the user. The navigation bar above the tables is used to add and remove the users&#39; own, personal entries. Users just need to be aware that it is still not possible to add new entries to these tables &#39;on the fly&#39;. A momentary pause in transcribing is necessary in order to add a new entry to the appropriate table so that it caan be used in the next record.</p>
