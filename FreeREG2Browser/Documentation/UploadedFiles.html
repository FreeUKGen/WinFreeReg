   <h1>Uploaded Files List</h1>

   <p>Entering the Uploaded Files list causes the program to query the FreeREG server and refresh the list of files that have previously been uploaded by the logged on User ID. This can, depending on the number of files, take a noticeable amount of time.</p>

   <p>When complete, the window will show a list of filenames on the left-hand side and the rest of the window is used to show some details about the selected file. The list is sortable by name, in ascending or descending sequence: just double-click on the column heading. A right-click on the heading also gives access to these sort options, along with some options related to Groups. For this list, the only grouping that makes any real sense when the transcriber has uploaded files for more than one county. In this case selecting to group the files by Batch will actually group them by County.</p>

   <p>From a file management point of view, all that can be done with the uploaded files is to either delete them or view their contents. This is indicated by the presnce of the buttons at the bottom of the window. Deleting a file will remove it from the FreeREG database so that locally, it becomes a new file again.</p>

   <p>Viewing the contents of a file is the initial step in downloading the file and storing it on the PC. The contents are displayed in a read-only screen that superficially looks like a Notepad window. Pressing the <span class="boldword">Save Transcription file to PC</span> button will result in a standard Windows dialog to save the file in the default folder.</p>
