   <h1>WinFreeREG - Starting Up</h1>

   <p>This program is the intended replacement for the original WinREG. As with the previous incarnation, it provides a transcribing tool for the creation of files that can be uploaded to the FreeREG web site. Unlike the previous version, it provides transcribers with an integrated means of uploading and managing those files on the new web site.</p>

   <p>When the program first starts, this window will require the user to fill in some fields: principally the user details and some preferences. Once these have been completed, the <span class="boldword">Begin</span> button can be pressed to show the main working area - the FreeREG Portal. Upon subsequent startups, this form will continue to be shown filled-in with the settings as they were when the program was shutdown. This allows you to work with multiple FreeREG User IDs and perhaps make use of multiple locations for storing transcription files - different locations for different User IDs.</p>

   <h2>First Steps</h2>
   
   <p>On the first opening of the program, fill in your <span class="boldword">Name</span> and your <span class="boldword">email address</span>. This email address can be different to the email address that FreeREG currently associates with you.</p>

   <p>Next, fill in your FreeREG <span class="boldword">User ID</span> and <span class="boldword">password</span>. These are what identify you to the FreeREG application. Your <span class="boldword">password</span> is hidden by default, but can be made visible by clicking on the small, underlines link next to the field. A second click on the link will hide a <span class="boldword">password</span> that is already showing.</p>

   <p>The next item to configure is that of your <span class="boldword">Default County</span>. This is the county that you normally transcribe for. It is used when starting to create a new transcription file, since it controls which places you can transcribe for and, more importantly, the spelling of those place and church names.</p>

   <p>The <span class="boldword">Url</span> is the address of the FreeREG server and should, under normal circumstances, not need changing. The only time this will/might need changing is when this piece of software and the associated server routines are made live. At that time, all new installations of the program will default to the live FreeREG server. Existing installations can either be removed and the reinstalled, or the Url changed manually.</p>

   <p>Finally, the <span class="boldword">Transcription File location</span> is the path to where your transcription files are kept. By default, this will be set to the default path as used by the previous version of WinREG. If this isn&#39;t where the files are stored, then you are quite at liberty to use the small <span class="boldword">Browse</span> link to select the correct place.</p>

   <p>After the initial login, you should definitely download some data from the FreeREG server. You need to populate some tables with data held on the server and which will make the uploading of future transcription files less prone to errors. See <a href="FreeregTables.html">FreeREG Tables</a></p>

<h2>Subsequent Openings</h2>

   <p>After the initial set up of the starting environment, the fields can be left alone. just click on the <span class="boldword">Begin</span> button to proceed. Alternatively, for those users (county coordinators?) that use multiple User IDs, change the FreeREG <span class="boldword">User ID</span> and <span class="boldword">password</span> to login under a different identity. If required, you can change the location of the Transcription Files if you maintain files for two or more different User IDs. For now, the program will only remember the last set of startup parameters that it is given. A future enhancement might permit multiple profiles to be stored and one of them selected when the program starts up.</p>
   
   <p>The small, <span class="boldword">Keep open</span> checkbox next to the <span class="boldword">Begin</span> button, allows the user to either redisplay the Startup window when returning from the main portal window, or to have it close automatically.</p>
