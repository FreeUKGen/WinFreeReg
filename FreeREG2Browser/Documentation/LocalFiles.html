   <h1>Local Files List</h1>

   <p>The Local Files List does is what it is: it&#39;s a list of all the transcription files that are found in the default folder or in the Transcriptions Library. What it tries to be is the central point through which transcription files can be edited, created and uploaded to the FreeREG server. </p>

   <p>For ease of use, the text of records will be colour-coded. Files in black need nothing doing to them. They haven&#39;t been changed since they were last uploaded. Files in green have been changed and most likely need replacing on the server. And files in red are new files and need to be uploaded to the server.</p>

   <p>Initially all local files will be in red unless you have first logged on to the server and downloaded a list of the files that have previously been uploaded to the server. This causes the date uploaded to appear and from that, and the date last changed, the program can decide what category each file falls into.</p>

   <h2>Sorting</h2>

   <p>The list is normally displayed in alphabetic sequence of filename. The only other column by which the list can be sorted is the Date Uploaded. This is achieved by double-clicking on the column header. Alternatively, right-clicking the Name or Date Uploaded column headings will bring up a context menu, in which the clicked column can be sorted in ascending or descending sequence.</p>

   <p>There is also an Unsort option which will return the list to the original sequence in which it was loaded.</p>

   <h2>Grouping</h2>

   <p>When the list is showing the contents of the Library,the files will, if there if more than one folder in the library, group the files according to which folder they reside in.</p>
   
   <p>The <span class="newStyle1">Date Uploaded</span> column has the extra capability of being able to group records together. Thus, all new files become a group as do all changed and unchanged files. Grouping is available on the context menu shown when the <span class="newStyle1">Data Uploaded</span> column heading is right-clicked. When the list is grouped like this, separator lines will appear denoting the category of each group. On the extreme right-hand end of these lines will an arrow. Initially the arrows will poit upwards showing that the group is expanded. Clicking the arrow makes it point downwards and condenses the group. The context menu also has an option to turn the groupings off.</p>

   <h2>File Summary</h2>

    <p>Hovering the mouse pointer over a file name and holding the Ctrl key down at the same time results in the program displaying a summary box containing some information about that file. This includes in Place and Church names and the number of records currently in the file.</p>

   <h2>Starting A New File</h2>

   <p>Creating a new file is simply a matter of clicking on the <span class="newStyle1">Start New File</span> button underneath the file list. See <a href="StartNewFile.html">Starting a new file</a> for more details.</p>


   <h2>Editing A File</h2>

   <p>To start editing an existing file, simply double-click anywhere on the line in the list. As an aid, the selected line will have a blue background, and the file name will be shown below the list on the left-hand side. See <a href="FileWorkspace.html">File Editing</a> for more details.</p>

   <h2>Extras</h2>

   <p>Extra functionality can be found when the user right-clicks on a file record. A context menu will appear, allowing the user to either view the file in Notepad (and perhaps edit it there) or (Careful With That Axe, Eugene!) delete it. Note that deleting the file need not be as catastrophic as it sounds, WinFreeREG takes care to ensure that the delted file can be recovered from the Recycle Bin.</p>
