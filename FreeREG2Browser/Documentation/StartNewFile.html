   <h1>WinFreeREG - Start New File</h1>

   <p>Creating a new file is largely a process of defining the data that goes into the transcription file header records. This also is the mechanism through which the file gets its name.</p>

   <p>At the very start of the process, the transcriber must select the County and the Placename. The County that is selected by default is that which was defined on the StartUp screen, but the transcriber can select any one of the Counties defined by the FreeREG server. As with other data-entry rules, the Place name can only be from the County that has been selected. If you have not downloaded the Placenames for the County that has been selected (see <a href="FreeregTables.html">FreeREG Tables</a> ) then file creation can not happen. The same applies to the Church name: if the program has not downloaded the Church record(s) for the selected Place, then a file can not be created.</p>

   <p>Once a Place and Church have been selected, the user is presented with the 3-character Placecode. This, along with the Chapman Code for the County and the Record type and the optional suffix, is what forms the filename. By default, the Placecode will initially be empty. The user should change this code, in which case the new value will be used henceforth. If the transcriber&#39;s coordinator tells the transcriber to use a particular code, this is where the code is entered. This should happen on the first file created by the transcriber for a new Place and Church combination.</p>
   
   <p>The 3-character Place code is stored in the associated Church record. Simply enter the code and click on the Update link to the right of the code. Then, the next time a file is created for this particular combination of Place and Church, the stored code will be used by default.</p>
