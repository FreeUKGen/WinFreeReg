   <h1>WinFreeREG - File Workspace</h1>

   <p>The File Workspace opens after the user has double-clicked on a file in the Local Files list. it shows a scrollable grid of all the records on the file and allows the user to edit the fields and add and remove records. </p>

   <p>Outwardly, the grid works in much the same way as it did in WinREG - although some of that functionality (such as duplicating data from a previous record) has not been included in this program.</p>

   <p>There is a button on the navigation bar that when pressed, allows the user to change some of the details kept in the header records of the transcription file. See <a href="FileDetails.html">File Details</a> for more details.</p>

   <h2>Extras</h2>

   <p>Right-clicking anywhere on the record display area results in the appearance of a context menu. At the moment, the available options are limited, allowing access to the <a href="FreeregTables.html" >FreeREG Tables</a> and, for files of Burials and Marriages, access to the <a href="UserTables.html">User Tables</a>.</p>
