   <h1>User Profile</h1>

   <p>The User Profile window shows details about the transcriber that have been downloaded from the FreeREG server when they logged on to the server. For the most part, the details shown are not very interesting, but they do serve to show the kind of information being kept by the server. Of particaular interest would be the number of files that the transcriber has uploaded and the total number of records in those files that are in the database.</p>
