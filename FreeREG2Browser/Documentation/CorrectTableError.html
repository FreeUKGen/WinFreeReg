   <h1>Correct Table Error</h1>
   
   <p>When there is an error in one of the User Tables, it is initially conveyed to the user in the Data Errors window. Double-clicking on the error line then opens the dialog where the user can correct the error.</p>
   <p>The window shows the parts of the table record that are accessible to the user: these are the Display field and the File field. The display field is what gets displayed to the user whilst the File field is what gets put into the transcription record. By default, the Display and File fields for Burial Relationships and the Marriage Conditions are set to be the same. But they do not need to be.</p>
   <p>The program tries to ensure that there are no errors in the tables. Basically the only errors that can occur are duplications of the Display fields: this is not permitted. Also, when new records are created, the program tries to make sure that the user enters something in both parts of the record. It does this by creating the initial record with known, default contents. Failure by the user to overwrite these defaults leads to an error.</p>
