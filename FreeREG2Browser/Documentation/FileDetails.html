   <h1>WinFreeREG - File Details</h1>

   <p>The File Details window is where some details kept in the header records, can be altered and corrected. Examination of the screen will show that the details that can be changed are all internal to the file and have no real external impact on the file name.</p>

   <p>The first thing to note is that the County can not be changed. The County will and always will be that which was assigned when the file was created. The Placename can be changed: but only to one of the places defined to be within the County. Similarly, the Church name can only be set to one of the members of the list of churches defined for that Place. This should go some way to ensuring the consistency of Place and Church names within the database.</p>

   <p>Like the County, it is not possible to change the Type of the records in the file. To do so makes no sense. However, the Register Type can be changed, as can all personal details (Names and email addresses) and Comments.</p>

   <h2>Changing Filenames</h2>

   <p>The details that can be edited have no real impact on the file name. This means that if the file was created using the wrong place code, then this program is not te way to change it. You must use something like Notepad to</p>

   <ol type="a">
      <li>Change the filename as it is recorded in header record 2</li>
      <li>Save the file under its&#39; new name</li>
   </ol>
